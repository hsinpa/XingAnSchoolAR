Welcome to the Happy Forest Library in Xing-An Elementary School. Our school is located on Ren-Ai Road which is known for its canopy of trees. With all these trees around us, it's just like being inside a forest! So we name our library the “Happy Forest Library” and hope everyone can find happiness in books.
