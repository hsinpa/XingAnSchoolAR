The entrance is the subtropical zone of the library. Do you see the wooden horse here? New books are displayed on the horse. There is also a big banyan tree here. There are chairs around the tree trunk, so you can sit down and enjoy a book or two.

Can you find the Taiwanese leopard cat hidden here? They have white spots behind their ears, and black or dark brown spots on their bodies. And there are black and white stripes on their foreheads and between their eyes. They are nocturnal, which means they usually come out at night.
